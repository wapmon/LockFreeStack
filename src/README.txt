This package will contain 3 separate classes: Main.java, TestModuleOne.java, and TestModuleTwo.java. Each of these should be compiled separately. The Main class is hard coded to run to completion, using 8 threads and 500,000 operations per thread. It is also an evenly distributed list of operations to perform. to compile, go to the directory where the .zip was unpacked and run command "javac Main.java" followed by "java Main". There is no input and The output will be the length of time each thread took to complete. To run the test modules, run the command "javac TestModule#.java" where # is either One or Two, followed by "java TestModule#". In TestModuleOne, you will be prompted to enter the number of threads you wish to use and the distribution of the operations will be roughly even. In TestModuleTwo you will again be prompted for the number of threads, but the distribution of operations will be 25%POP/75%PUSH. The report is also included in this document in PDF format.
